# Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in _Frontier: Beyond Sol_, emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization. Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these challenges and ensure the characters' survival and progress in the game.

## Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on structures or spacecraft.

## Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character actions and decision-making.

## Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits, utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or even life-threatening conditions for characters. The Referee can introduce mechanics for monitoring temperature levels, making temperature-related skill checks, or incorporating events where characters must deal with unexpected temperature fluctuations.

## Scarcity of Resources

Resources in space are limited, and characters must face the challenges of managing and rationing essential supplies such as oxygen, water, food, and energy. The scarcity of resources adds an additional layer of tension and decision-making to the game. Characters may need to engage in resource acquisition missions, establish mining operations, or trade with other factions to secure the necessary supplies for survival and mission objectives. The Referee can implement resource management mechanics, encounters related to resource scarcity, or events that test characters' ability to make tough choices regarding resource allocation.

## Environmental Suits and Scientific Equipment

Environmental suits provide protection against the harsh space environments, including temperature extremes, radiation, and micrometeoroids. Characters must have access to and maintain environmental suits to venture outside habitats or spacecraft. Additionally, scientific equipment such as spectrometers, telescopes, or microscopes allow characters to gather valuable data, conduct experiments, and make discoveries. These tools are essential for scientific research and can provide insights into the environment, resources, and potential threats.
