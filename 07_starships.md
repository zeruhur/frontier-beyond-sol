**EMBARKATION:** Basic personnel shuttles and escape pods. Upgrades: Additional heavy shuttlecraft, armored boarding torpedoes.  

**HULL:** Reinforced titanium-alloy hull for deep space. Upgrades: Ablative armor plating, radiation shielding.

**LIFE SUPPORT:** Recyclers, protein synth-tanks, oxygen scrubbers. Upgrades: Hydroponics bay, cryogenic stasis chambers.

**SENSORS:** Basic long-range/threat detection scanners. Upgrades: Gravimetric amplifiers, subspace resonators.

**POWER:** Fusion reactor with backup battery arrays. Upgrades: Anti-matter injection, redundant reactor loops.   

**PROPULSION:** Fusion torch engines and maneuvering thrusters. Upgrades: Ion/Plasma drives, warp coils, jumpdrive motivators.

**DEFENSES:** Armor plating. Upgrades: Ablative hull armor, interceptor decoys/flares.

**ARMAMENTS:** None standard. Upgrades: Point-defense lasers, missile launchers, railguns.

Effective starship combat capabilities depend heavily on the upgrades implemented. Wise captains balance offense, defense and support upgrades for well-rounded performance.

## Starship Types and Classes

### Interstellar Explorers
- **Pioneer Vessel**: Large ships designed for long-duration interstellar voyages, equipped for the exploration of new star systems and resource mapping. They function both as mobile laboratories and as advanced bases for exploration.
- **Exploratory Outpost**: Ships that are more compact compared to Pioneer Vessels but equally equipped for long-duration exploration missions and logistical support for landing operations on unexplored worlds.
- **Galactic Herald**: Designed to be the first to visit new star systems, these agile ships conduct preliminary surveys and prepare the ground for more extensive exploration missions.

### Connection Cruisers
- **Jumpgate Cruiser**: Specialized to operate near "jumpgates," these cruisers facilitate transport between connected star systems, offering logistical and defensive support along the main commercial and exploration routes.
- **Stellar Sentinel**: Well-armed cruisers that patrol the transit routes around jumpgates, protecting them from external threats.
- **Gate Binder**: Specialized in coordinating traffic through jumpgates, these ships act as control centers for interstellar transit operations.

### Cargo and Mining Vessels
- **Multifunction Space Cargo**: Sturdy ships designed for the transport of goods and resources between and within star systems. Some versions are specialized for mining in asteroids or planets.
- **Armored Transport**: Reinforced variants of cargo ships, designed to transport valuable goods or hazardous materials in maximum security.
- **Planetary Extractor**: Huge ships equipped with advanced mining extraction systems for operating on resource-rich planets.

### Scientific Ships
- **Mobile Orbital Laboratory**: Spaceships dedicated to scientific research, equipped with advanced laboratories for studies on space phenomena, extraterrestrial biology, and emerging technologies. They operate both independently and in support of broader missions.
- **Deep Space Observatory**: Ships dedicated to the in-depth study of remote astronomical phenomena, with powerful detection and computation instruments.
- **Bio-Explorer**: Specialized in the search for extraterrestrial life forms, equipped with laboratories for biological analysis and quarantine facilities.

### Battleships and Defense Ships
- **Stellar Defender**: Heavily armed vessels designed to protect inhabited star systems and commercial routes from space pirates and other threats. They serve as bastions of the Sol Union's security.
- **Stellar Fortress**: Huge armored ships that serve as mobile bases for large-scale military operations.
- **Guard Station**: Armed platforms located near jumpgates to provide static defense and access control.

### Rapid Transports and Couriers
- **Stellar Clipper**: Fast and agile, these ships are used for rapid delivery missions, critical interstellar communications, and quick rescue operations.
- **Interplanetary Falcon**: Fast and agile, these ships serve as rapid couriers for urgent communications and the transport of personnel or light loads within individual star systems.
- **Quantum Lance**: Specialized in the transport of data and communications through jumpgates, using advanced quantum communication systems.

### Frontier Explorers
- **Frontier Scout**: Small agile ships designed for the rapid exploration of new worlds in frontier regions. Equipped for short surface missions and orbit-based reconnaissance.
- **Galactic Probe**: Small unmanned robotic probes sent to explore dangerous or unexplored systems before the arrival of manned ships.
- **Anomaly Hunter**: Designed to locate and investigate unusual spatial phenomena such as spacetime curvatures or fields of exotic energy.

### Colony Ships
- **Interstellar Ark**: Gigantic colony ships designed to transport large numbers of people and basic infrastructure to new worlds. They serve as temporary bases while colonies are established.
- **Colonial Vanguard**: More compact versions of the Interstellar Arks, they transport pre-fabricated outposts and supplies for preliminary settlements.
- **Mother Fortress**: Huge mobile aerospace colonies, capable of sustaining entire human habitats for long periods and establishing permanent settlements on a new world.

### Medical and Rescue Ships
- **Stellar Hospital**: Mobile rescue and care units, capable of rapidly reaching crisis areas or providing medical assistance in remote regions of space.
- **Flying Clinic**: Smaller medical ships intended to assist remote colonies or exploration crews with first-rate care.
- **Stellar Refuge**: Huge refuge ships equipped to evacuate entire populations from endangered star systems and provide emergency shelter.

## Combat

### Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise between factions during interplanetary travel, space combat mechanics can be used. Combat follows a similar structure to regular combat, with rounds and action sequences.

### Ship Attributes 

Spacecraft have their own functions, such as Hull, Weapons, Armor, and Propulsion. These determine the capabilities and effectiveness of the spacecraft in combat situations. The Referee can create a set of ship attributes or use pre-defined ship templates for ease of play.

### Ship Actions

During space combat, characters can take various ship actions, such as attacking with weapons, evasive maneuvers, deploying countermeasures, or targeting specific ship systems. The actions available depend on the ship's capabilities and the character's skills.

### Combat Rolls 

Combat rolls are used to determine the outcomes of attacks and defensive actions. These rolls take into account the attacker's skill, ship attributes, and potential modifiers based on the situation. Damage inflicted on the target ship is calculated, considering the defender's armor and other defensive systems.

### Boarding Actions 

In addition to ship-to-ship combat, characters may engage in boarding actions, attempting to breach enemy ships and engage in close-quarters combat. Boarding actions follow similar rules to regular combat, with characters utilizing their skills and weapons to overcome enemy forces.

### Consequences and Repairs 

Space combat can have long-lasting consequences, damaging ship systems and potentially causing critical failures. Characters must deal with the aftermath of combat, including repairing their ships, tending to injured crew members, and managing limited resources in the hostile environment of space.
