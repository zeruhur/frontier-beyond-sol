# What is Frontier: Beyond Earth

*Frontier: Beyond Earth* (FBS) is a roleplaying game in which you will
define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur
through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an
emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional
setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that
will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will
have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of FBS takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the
other players.

  - The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and
    setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing
    Characters.
  - The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their
    Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their
    conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out
    their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask
    questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

  - At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal
    number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
  - A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
  - Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for
    note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the
following principles in mind:

  - **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally
    streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you
    are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems,
    there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your
    preferences.
  - **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different
    responsibilities than the other players, they should still be
    considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more
    responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the
    table.
  - **Referee's Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against
    other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within
    the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining
    consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or
    conflicts that may arise during play.
  - **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played
    collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges
    as a group. As such, competition between players should be
    discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The
    characters should work together to confront the obstacles and
    threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in
    individualistic or adversarial behavior.
  - **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a
    concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should
    provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the
    potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters.
    This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and
    understand the consequences of their actions.
  - **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first
    provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is
    attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described
    should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine
    the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative
    flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the
    sequence of events.
  - **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where
    the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and
    interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments,
    and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters'
    actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that
    arise from collaborative storytelling, and don't be afraid to
    deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
  - **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of
    this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the
    twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning
    every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This
    willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most
    memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the
    uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing Frontier: Beyond Sol, it is important to embrace a sense of
realism that remains consistent with the game's setting, backgrounds,
equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is
designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and
captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior
knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources
of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game's
intricacies. While true "realism" is impossible in a fictional game, it
is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for
consistency with the established setting and adhere to general
principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in
an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the
established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to
unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be
comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with
the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish
clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to
be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout
the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for
communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a
comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such
as [Lines And
Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean),
[C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/),

and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques
and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and
comfortable during the game.

# How to play

The role of the Referee is to control the game universe: he describes
situations, NPCs, and their reactions to the PCs' actions. He or she
should be as clear as possible about the conditions of the context in
which the characters are immersed: if there is a reasonable certainty
that the character has access to a piece of information or knowledge,
the referee should communicate it to the player, without asking for a
roll. In this game, a roll is made only for situations of risk or
uncertainty of the outcome of a direct action.

  - If an action is impossible, the referee simply declares it so by
    explaining why and describing the possible alternatives to the
    player.
  - If the cost of an action is explicit, the referee will clearly
    present it. The player can decide whether to take the action or try
    another one.
  - If the action involves a risk, the referee will communicate this
    clearly. The player will be able to make informed decisions about
    the action they want to take and they will pull to determine the
    outcome.

In all other cases, the action is automatically successful.

## Rolling

When a character attempts an action with significant risk, the player
rolls a skill die to determine the outcome. The default is a d6.

  - If the character has applicable skills or talents, they roll a
    bigger die like d8 or d10 to represent competence.
  - Conversely, if \_hindered \_by injuries or obstacles may warrant a
    smaller die like d4 to show impairment.

The player can also roll bonus dice based on circumstances:

  - Favorable conditions grant an extra d6 die. Things like having the
    high ground in combat or proper tools for a repair task.
  - An ally who helps adds their own skill die to the roll, representing
    combined effort. The ally shares in any risk.

The player rolls their skill die plus any bonus dice, taking the single
highest result.

  - **1-2, disaster.** The full brunt of the risk occurs, and the
    Referee judges if there is any success at all. A roll this bad could
    mean instant death when mortality is on the line.
  - **3-4, setback.** You suffer a lesser or partial consequence. If
    risking death, the character might survive but with a grievous
    injury and *hindered*.
  - **5+, success.** The higher numbers, the better the outcomes.

The core mechanic balances risk versus reward, with competence and
teamwork aiding success. But dire consequences are still possible,
maintaining high drama and tension.

## Load

Characters can carry as many possessions as reasonably fits their
physical capacity and the storage space on their person. For example, a
character could carry a weapon, some tools, and a backpack containing
rations and other useful adventuring gear.

However, if a character loads themselves down with multiple overly bulky
or heavy items, it may hinder their ability to move and act freely at
times. For instance, carrying a large shield, a two-handed weapon, and a
bulging sack of gear may make it difficult to squeeze through narrow
spaces or balance while climbing.

In such cases, the referee will inform the player that their character's
encumbrance is \_hindering \_their movement or dexterity in the current
situation. The player can then decide to temporarily set down some of
their carried items to proceed unfettered, stowing the extra gear nearby
to be retrieved later. Or they may opt to continue carrying everything,
accepting additional challenges or risks to their intended actions.

## Advancement

After successfully completing a mission or major story milestone, each
player character will improve in the following ways as a reward for
their accomplishments:

  - Increase one of their skill ranks by one step on the progression
    track (none → d8 → d10 → d12). This represents honing their
    competencies through experience.
  - Gain a number of currency credits (₡) equal to a d6 roll. Credits
    can be spent to acquire new gear, weapons, cyberware, services, etc.
    The die roll result encourages uncertainty in the exact amount of
    new wealth obtained.

For example, after infiltrating an enemy base undetected and stealing
valuable data, a character with stealth and hacking skills currently at
d8 could increase their stealth to d10 for greater sneaking ability.
They also would gain somewhere between 1-6 credits to spend on desired
upgrades and purchases.

This dual progression system rewards both new capabilities and
resources, allowing characters to become more powerful and versatile
over the course of the campaign. The incremental upgrades create a
satisfying sense of growth and advancement for each successful mission.
But the unpredictability keeps material gain uncertain, maintaining
long-term goals and motivation.

## Damage Control

Say how you use a piece of gear to absorb damage. It's disabled until
repaired at a base.

When a character is about to take damage from an attack or hazard, the
player can describe how they utilize a piece of equipment to absorb some
or all of the incoming damage. This could involve actions like raising a
shield to block an incoming blow, using a large tool as cover from an
explosion, or angling a vehicle to have an attack hit a reinforced
section.

After being used to soak damage this way, that gear becomes disabled and
non-functional until it can be repaired back at a home base or facility
with the proper tools and parts.

The referee will determine if using the gear fully negates the attack or
just reduces the damage taken. More powerful or intense attacks may
overwhelm a piece of gear's protection capacity.

## Injuries

If a character sustains a serious injury during a game session, they
will need to spend some in-game time in the medical bay to recover. The
player should describe their character receiving medical treatment and
the referee can narrate the passage of time during the healing process.

If a character is killed, the player should introduce a new character as
soon as is practical. The referee should facilitate quickly integrating
the new character into the ongoing story.

When adjudicating the effects of injuries or character death, inclusion
of the affected player takes priority over adhering to strict realism.
The referee should aim to avoid excluding a player from participation
due to their character being incapacitated. Workarounds like having the
player take temporary control of a supporting character can help keep
everyone involved.

The risks of combat and other dangerous activities are an important part
of the game's drama and stakes. However, the ultimate goal is for
everyone to have fun together. So when serious consequences occur, the
referee should guide the narrative in a direction that returns the
affected player to active participation in a seamless, collaborative
manner.

## Game mastering

The referee portrays non-player characters (NPCs) by describing their
behaviors, motivations, and obstacles they present to the player
characters. The referee should lead the group in establishing boundaries
for subject matter and conduct during play.

To control pacing and safety, the referee can fast-forward through
uneventful stretches, pause play for breaks or sidebar discussions, or
even rewind and redo a scene if needed. The referee should invite
players to request scene edits too.

The referee should present dilemmas and challenges without pre-planned
solutions, allowing the players to drive the direction of the story
through their choices.

To give everyone screen time, the referee moves the spotlight around,
checking in with each player in turn.

To inject randomness and chaos, the referee can occasionally test for
bad luck by rolling a die - a 1-2 means trouble occurs, like running out
of ammo at a bad time or stumbling into patrolling guards. A 3-4
indicates signs of impending trouble.

When the written rules don't adequately cover a situation, the referee
improvises rulings in the moment to keep the game moving. If any rulings
seem unsatisfactory, the group should discuss them on a break and revise
them collaboratively.

The referee portrays the world and inhabitants surrounding the player
characters. By sharing narrative power while guiding pacing and
monitoring safety, the referee enables the group to collectively build
an exciting and satisfying story.

# Interstellar Travel

Interstellar travel in this universe is not only about reaching distant
star systems but also about managing resources, calculating travel times
through hyperspace corridors or wormholes, and facing unexpected
encounters along the journey. The advanced propulsion systems and
starships available offer a range of options, each with its own
capabilities and limitations.

As you traverse the vastness of interstellar space, be prepared for the
unexpected. Navigation hazards, random anomalies, and dangerous
encounters may test your skills and decision-making. Whether negotiating
with alien civilizations, repairing hyperdrives, or avoiding cosmic
phenomena, your voyages will be filled with peril and wonder.

## Navigation Hazards

Navigating across interstellar distances presents unique challenges
requiring precise calculations and skillful execution. Characters must
navigate gravitational forces, celestial bodies, radiation hazards, and
the complexities of hyperspace/wormhole travel to reach destinations
safely.

During journeys, they may face:

1.  **Astrogation Challenges:** Plotting interstellar courses demands
    advanced astrogation accounting for factors like star locations,
    gravity wells, hyperspace corridors and jump points. Navigation
    checks determine trajectory accuracy and efficiency.

2.  **Gravity Slingshots:** Using a celestial body's gravity can
    multiply a ship's velocity. Characters must identify opportunities
    for gravity slingshots and execute complex maneuvers.

3.  **Hazardous Regions:** Certain areas teem with dangers like
    radiation clouds, asteroid fields or spatial anomalies. Characters
    must navigate around or shield against these threats.

4.  **Celestial Obstacles:** Ships may encounter rogue comets, debris
    fields or other stellar obstacles requiring evasive maneuvers to
    avoid collisions.

Characters skilled in astrogation, astrometrics and hyperspace physics
will better overcome these challenges through calculation mastery and
maneuver expertise.

### Random Interstellar Encounter Table

Roll 2d6 to determine a random encounter:

1.  **Spatial Anomaly:** The ship encounters strange phenomena like
    subspace eddies, gravitational lensing or radiation spikes requiring
    emergency navigation.

2.  **Distress Signal:** Characters receive a distress call they can
    investigate for trade, rescue or danger.

3.  **Debris Field:** The ship must navigate a field of ancient wreckage
    or technological debris, avoiding collisions.

4.  **Derelict Hulk:** Characters discover an abandoned alien craft, a
    chance for salvage or discovery of lost archeotech.

5.  **Astrogation Failure:** Systems experience a temporary astrogation
    failure, forcing manual navigation to get back on course.

6.  **Asteroid Hazard:** The ship traverses an asteroid belt requiring
    precision maneuvers to avoid destructive impacts.

7.  **Subspace Rift:** A rift or wormhole aperture appears, offering a
    shortcut or gateway to the unknown.

8.  **Pirate Ambush:** Hostile ships attempt to intercept, board or
    disable the characters' vessel requiring evasion or combat.

9.  **Trade Opportunity:** Characters encounter a trader convoy offering
    a chance to barter for rare goods or intel.

10. **Celestial Phenomenon:** A rare stellar event like a pulsar flare
    or comet's passing presents awe or research opportunities.

11. **Alien Artifact:** The ship's sensors detect a drifting alien
    artifact of potentially immense value or power.

Interstellar voyages demand exceptional astrogation skills, quick
reactions and courage to overcome navigation perils and strange
encounters lurking in the cosmic void between stars.

Here is a potential chapter entitled "Travel Time and Fuel Consumption"
that considers realistic interplanetary travel and the use of jumpgate
technology in this setting:

## Travel Time and Fuel Consumption

Interstellar travel in this universe requires careful planning and
resource management. Two main methods exist - conventional
interplanetary travel within star systems, and utilization of the rare
and precious jumpgate technology to traverse between neighboring
systems.

### Interplanetary Travel

For voyages within a single star system, spacecraft must rely on
conventional propulsion technology like fusion torches and Ion engines.
These provide high levels of acceleration over long periods, but are
still bound by the limits of relativistic physics.

Travel times between planets in a system can take weeks or months
depending on the distances involved. A trip from Earth to the orbit of
Neptune in our Solar system could take over 8 months with continuous
acceleration and deceleration.

Fuel requirements scale with the mass of the spacecraft and desired
acceleration rates. A large cargo hauler may require thousands of tons
of fuel for an interplanetary journey, while efficient exploration craft
can make do with far less.

Key considerations:

  - Conventional interplanetary drives are reliable but sluggish
  - High acceleration rates are possible but consume exponentially more
    fuel
  - In-system resource extraction and refueling is often necessary
  - Travel times must account for months of acceleration and
    deceleration

### Jumpgate Technology

The pivotal invention of jumpgate technology revolutionized interstellar
travel by allowing effective faster-than-light transit between star
systems up to 15 light-years apart. Jumpgates are artificially sustained
wormholes stabilized by rare minerals and immense industrial
megastructures.

While passage through a jumpgate is nearly instantaneous, the gates
themselves are incredibly rare. The handful of known stable jumpgates
discovered so far connect wealthy inner spheres of human-occupied space.

Operating a jumpgate requires astronomical quantities of exotic matter
and antimatter fuel sources. This ensures they remain under strict
control of system authorities and powerful corporations.

Key limitations:

  - Only a few dozen jumpgates exist across inhabited space
  - Maximum range is 15 light-years between connected gates
  - Transits are effectively instantaneous but consume huge resources
  - Undiscovered systems lack gate access entirely

Given the scarcity of jumpgates, most interstellar travel still relies
on protracted conventional voyages at sub-light speeds. Even with gate
access, in-system travel requires months of careful planning. Jumpgates
are highly strategic assets, but do not fully alleviate the challenges
and perils of interstellar exploration and resource logistics in this
universe.

# Environmental Hazards

Environmental Hazards play a significant role in *Frontier: Beyond Sol*,
emphasizing the harsh realities and challenges of space colonization.
Characters will encounter a range of hazards that pose risks to their
well-being and mission success. These hazards include radiation
exposure, microgravity environments, extreme temperatures, and the
scarcity of resources. Mechanisms are in place to address these
challenges and ensure the characters' survival and progress in the game.

## Radiation Exposure

Space is filled with various forms of radiation that can be harmful to
humans and equipment. Characters must navigate through regions with
higher radiation levels cautiously, utilize radiation shielding
materials and equipment to minimize exposure, and monitor radiation
levels to avoid long-term health effects. The Referee may introduce
radiation events or zones that require characters to make decisions
regarding their routes, resource allocation for shielding, or even
engaging in special missions to repair or secure radiation shielding on
structures or spacecraft.

## Microgravity Environments

In microgravity conditions, characters experience weightlessness, which
can affect their physical capabilities and equipment. Characters must
adapt to the challenges of moving, performing tasks, and manipulating
objects in a microgravity environment. They may require specialized
training or equipment, such as magnetic boots or handheld propulsion
devices, to maintain stability and maneuver effectively. The Referee can
introduce skill checks or mechanics to simulate the unique physics of
microgravity, adding an additional layer of complexity to character
actions and decision-making.

## Extreme Temperatures

The vastness of space brings extreme temperature variations, from
freezing cold to scorching heat. Characters must prepare for these
extreme temperatures by wearing appropriate environmental suits,
utilizing temperature regulation systems, and ensuring proper insulation
in their habitats and vehicles. Failure to manage temperature extremes
can lead to equipment malfunctions, damage to life support systems, or
