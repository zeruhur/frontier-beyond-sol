# What is Frontier: Beyond Sol

_Frontier: Beyond Sol_ (FBS) is a roleplaying game in which you will define an imagined space bounded by rules. Actions and events occur through procedure-driven player interaction. This facilitates an emergent shared narrative.

Put plainly, players will assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. The characters will act according to the rules of the game that will guarantee their success or failure. The outcome of actions will have an effect on the narrative that emerges.

A game of FBS takes place as a conversation between the Referee and the other players.

- The Referee sets up the situation, describes the environment and setting, moves the dialogue and actions of the Non-Playing Characters.
- The Players move in the imagined space of the game through their Playing Character, describing their actions and narrating their conversations. It is up to each player to decide whether to act out their Character or play them impersonally. Players should also ask questions of clarification to the Referee.

To play you will need:

- At least 2 players, one will cover the role of Referee. The ideal number of players is 4-5 players, maximum 6.
- A complete set of polyhedral dice, preferably one for each player.
- Writing instruments, index cards and sheets of paper for note-taking.

## Game Principles

It is important that everyone at the table feels comfortable and has the following principles in mind:

- **Fiction over mechanics.** This ruleset is intentionally streamlined and prioritizes fiction over complex mechanics. If you are primarily interested in a game with detailed mechanical systems, there are other rulesets that may be better suited to your preferences.
- **The Referee is a player.** Although the Referee has different responsibilities than the other players, they should still be considered as a fellow player and should not shoulder more responsibility for the success of the game than anyone else at the table.
- **Referee's Mediating Role.** The Referee does not compete against other players; their role is solely to arbitrate situations within the context of the game. They are responsible for maintaining consistency, ensuring fairness, and resolving any disputes or conflicts that may arise during play.
- **Promote Cooperative Play.** This game is intended to be played collaboratively, with a focus on teamwork and overcoming challenges as a group. As such, competition between players should be discouraged in favor of cooperation and mutual support. The characters should work together to confront the obstacles and threats posed by the game world, rather than engaging in individualistic or adversarial behavior.
- **Information Query.** Players should ask the Referee questions in a concise and straightforward manner. The Referee, in turn, should provide clear and detailed explanations of the context and the potential risks associated with each action taken by the characters. This helps to ensure that players make informed decisions and understand the consequences of their actions.
- **Action first.** When describing an action, players should first provide a clear and detailed description of what their character is attempting to do. Only after the action has been fully described should the Referee request a dice roll, if necessary, to determine the outcome of the action. This helps to ensure that the narrative flows smoothly and that players have a clear understanding of the sequence of events.
- **Emergent Fiction.** The game thrives on emergent fiction, where the narrative evolves naturally from player choices and interactions. Be prepared for unexpected twists and developments, and allow the story to unfold organically based on the characters' actions and decisions. Embrace the creativity and spontaneity that arise from collaborative storytelling, and don't be afraid to deviate from preconceived notions of how the plot should progress.
- **Embrace uncertainty.** Embracing uncertainty is at the core of this game. Embrace the unpredictability of player choices and the twists and turns the narrative may take. Avoid rigidly planning every detail and be open to adapting to the unexpected. This willingness to embrace uncertainty can lead to some of the most memorable and engaging moments in the game, so relish the uncertainty and let it guide the storytelling.

## A word about “realism”

In playing Frontier: Beyond Sol, it is important to embrace a sense of realism that remains consistent with the game's setting, backgrounds, equipment, and accompanying illustrations. This hard sci-fi universe is designed to inspire players and immerse them in a believable and captivating experience. While it is not mandatory to have prior knowledge of the specific science fiction genre or to read the sources of inspiration, doing so can deepen the appreciation for the game's intricacies. While true "realism" is impossible in a fictional game, it is crucial to avoid indulging in absurdities and instead strive for consistency with the established setting and adhere to general principles of physics. By embracing this approach, players can engage in an authentic and immersive gaming experience that respects the established rules and allows for a compelling and plausible narrative to unfold.

## Safety Tools

It is important to remember that not everyone at the table may be comfortable with the themes or content addressed by the game, or with the actions of the other players. It is therefore important to establish clear boundaries and expectations at the beginning of the game, and to be sensitive to the needs and feelings of all participants throughout the session. It may also be helpful to establish a system for communicating discomfort or taking breaks if needed.

There are various safety tools and techniques that can help create a comfortable and safe environment for everyone involved in the game, such as [Lines And Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean), [C.A.T.S.](http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/), the [X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit?usp=sharing), and [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/).

It is important to familiarize yourself with these tools and techniques and to use them proactively to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable during the game.
